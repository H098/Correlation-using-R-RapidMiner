# Correlation-using-R-RapidMiner
In this project I have created a correlation system that correlates different attribute values related to the recent pandemic COVID-19 effects in Russia, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The system takes different attributesâ€™ values and then finds the correlation among the attributes, hence bringing to light the major affected fields due to the new virus.

This project using dataset with specific dates and attributes 
The analysis is performed on each country alone
In each Country file you will find 
1- The dataset used
2- The RapidMiner repository
3- The R language Scripts
4- The plotted Picture 
5-The Documentation and analysis
